This file contains instructions for developers and advanced users that
want to build from version controlled sources.

We require several tools to check out and build the software, including:

- Make <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/>
- Automake <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/> (use 1.11.3 or later)
- Autoconf <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>
- Autogen <http://www.gnu.org/software/autogen/> (use 5.16 or later)
- Libtool <http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/>
- Gettext <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>
- Texinfo <http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/>
- Tar <http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/>
- Gzip <http://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/>
- Texlive & epsf <http://www.tug.org/texlive/> (for PDF manual)
- CVS <http://www.gnu.org/software/cvs/> (for gettext autopoint)
- GTK-DOC <http://www.gtk.org/gtk-doc/> (for API manual)
- Git <http://git-scm.com/>
- Perl <http://www.cpan.org/>
- Valgrind <http://valgrind.org/> (optional)
- Nettle <http://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/nettle/>
- Guile <http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/>
- p11-kit <http://p11-glue.freedesktop.org/p11-kit.html>
- libtasn1 <http://josefsson.org/libtasn1/> (optional)
- datefudge <http://packages.debian.org/datefudge> (optional)
- Libidn <http://www.gnu.org/software/libidn/> (optional, for crywrap)
- AWK <http://www.gnu.org/software/awk/> (for make dist, pmccabe2html)
- git2cl <http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/git2cl/> (for make dist, ChangeLog)

The required software is typically distributed with your operating
system, and the instructions for installing them differ.  Here are
some hints:

gNewSense/Debian/Ubuntu:
apt-get install git-core autoconf libtool gettext autopoint
apt-get install texinfo texlive texlive-generic-recommended texlive-extra-utils
apt-get install help2man gtk-doc-tools valgrind
apt-get install guile-1.8-dev libtasn1-3-dev
apt-get install datefudge libidn11-dev gawk

You will sometimes need to install more recent versions of Automake,
Nettle, P11-kit and Autogen, which you will need to build from
sources.  If your system has the recent versions, you could do:

apt-get install automake autogen nettle-dev libp11-kit-dev

To download the version controlled sources:

$ git clone git://gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls.git
$ cd gnutls

The next step is to run autoreconf (etc) and then ./configure:

$ make bootstrap

When built this way, some developer defaults will be enabled.  See
cfg.mk for details.

Then build the project normally:

$ make
$ make check

If you wish to contribute, you may read more about our coding style in
doc/README.CODING_STYLE. Note that when contributing code that is not 
assigned to FSF, you will need to assert that the contribution is in 
accordance to the "Developer's Certificate of Origin" as found in the 
file doc/DCO.txt. That can be done by sending a mail with your real name to 
the gnutls-devel mailing list. Then just make sure that your contributions 
(patches), contain a "Signed-off-by" line, with your name and e-mail address. 
To automate the process use "git am -s" to produce patches.

Happy hacking!
